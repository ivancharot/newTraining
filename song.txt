It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges
Boats
And other dreary worlds you know
Let's get happy!

It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile without a doubt
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump and sing and shout
Let's get happy!

But it's much to late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
For rip-zipping button-popping kiss and well...
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy!
